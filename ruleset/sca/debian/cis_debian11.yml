    title: "Ensure events that modify the system's network environment are collected"
    description: "Record changes to network environment files or system calls. The below parameters monitors the following system calls, and write an audit event on system call exit: sethostname - set the systems host name setdomainname - set the systems domain name .The files being monitored are: /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net - messages displayed pre-login . /etc/hosts - file containing host names and associated IP addresses . /etc/networks - symbolic names for networks . /etc/network/ - directory containing network interface scripts and configurations files"
    rationale: "Monitoring sethostname and setdomainname will identify potential unauthorized changes to host and domainname of a system. The changing of these names could potentially break security parameters that are set based on those names. The /etc/hosts file is monitored for changes that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change machine associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to unintended machines. Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing information to the intruder. Monitoring /etc/network is important as it can show if network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way that can lead to the machine becoming unavailable or compromised. All audit records should have a relevant tag associated with them."

    description: "Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount ) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non- privileged user"
    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

    additional information: "As noted in the journald man pages, journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like systemd- journald.service. There are trade-offs involved in each implementation, where ForwardToSyslog will immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities. Mechanisms such as systemd-journald.service, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export. Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system. The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the custom *.conf files.

    rationale: "It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive data is archived and protected."

    impact: "The systems global umask could override, but only making the file permissions stricter, what is configured in RSyslog with the FileCreateMode directive. RSyslog also has it's own $umask directive that can alter the intended file creation mode. In addition, consideration should be given to how FileCreateMode is used. Thus it is critical to ensure that the intended file creation mode is not overridden with less restrictive settings in /etc/rsyslog.conf, /etc/rsyslog.d/*conf files and that FileCreateMode is set before any file is created."
