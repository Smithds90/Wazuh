overview: |

  The system module collects and parses logs created by the system logging service of common Unix/Linux based distributions.

  System-auth logs include auth logs like sudo, ssh, and cron logs

compatibility: This integration was tested with logs from OSes like Ubuntu 12.04, Centos 7.

configuration: |
  This integration ingests logs from /var/log/syslog and /var/log/auth.log (the location of the files
  can be configured in the localfile configuration).

  As mentioned above, we use the logcollector source localfile to ingest the logs from both files.

  Adding to the ossec.conf file in the monitored agent the following blocks:
  ```xml
  <localfile>
    <location>/var/log/syslog</location>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
  </localfile>
  <localfile>
    <location>/var/log/messages</location>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
  </localfile>
  <localfile>
    <location>/var/log/secure</location>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
  </localfile>
  <localfile>
  <location>/var/log/auth.log</location>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
  </localfile>
  <localfile>
  <location>/var/log/kern.log</location>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
  </localfile>
  ```
